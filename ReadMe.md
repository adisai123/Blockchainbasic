Blockchain : blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, public ledger.


https://demoblockchain.org/hash
blockchain uses : SHA256 Hash (hashing is dfferent from encryption)
Miners : job is to process and validate or confirm the transaction.(for that so much power computers required) (they do that by solving math problem and cryptography issues)(rewarded in bitcoin)
role of the miners is to build blockchin of record  that form a bitcoin ledger.( each of this blocks linked to previous block)


https://demoblockchain.org/block
1 valid hash has starting 0000   ex: 0000f727854b50bb95c054b39c1fe5c92e5ebcfa4bcb5dc279f56aa96a365e5a

structure : block number , Nonce , data , previous hash , hash 

 A nonce is a number that is used only once as part of the mining process in Bitcoin.

A purely peer to peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be send directly from one party to another without going through finantial institution.


# Merkle tree

In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains.

Merkle root is the summary of all the transaction in that block.


There will be a maximum number of 21 million bitcoins available. This number will be reached in the year 2140.
